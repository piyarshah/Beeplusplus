Bee++ was developed as a practical tool to support biodiversity observation and conservation efforts. Designed to record, categorise, and manage local species sightings, it serves as a starting point for building a more comprehensive environmental monitoring system.

By combining structured data management with user-friendly functionality, Bee++ empowers users to contribute valuable observations â€” whether they are researchers, students, or nature enthusiasts. The project reflects a commitment to blending computer science with real-world environmental challenges, encouraging data-driven insights to support local ecosystems.
